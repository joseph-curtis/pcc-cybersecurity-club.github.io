<h3>Shout Outs - Team Game</h3>
<p>Both teams representing PCC2 rocked the leaderboards and had a blast doing it.  Teams communicate via separate Discord servers throughout the event and use an organized Google spreadsheet to keep track of questions and answers before submission, which helps keep accuracy high.</p>

<p>Thank you, Team Captains, for the work you put in to get these teams together and setup the communication environments!  We appreciate you!</p>

<h3>Shout Outs - Individual Game:</h3>
<p>Kort Witkowski (2655 points out of 3000) and Blake Eakin (2490 points out of 3000) both placed in the top 100 out of 5,357 competitors.  Congratulations gentlemen!</p>

<p>We had a few members this year that had never competed before and we would like to recognize everyone’s hard work preparing for and competing in such a tough event!  Watch out Fall Season, we’re coming for you next!</p>
