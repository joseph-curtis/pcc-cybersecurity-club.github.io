<h3>What does it cost to be a member?</h3>
<p>Membership dues are a minimum donation of $25 due upon registration and again annually on or before your anniversary of becoming a member.  Dues are coordinated by the Treasurer but are paid directly to the club's ASPCC fundraising account.  Officers will attempt to send out reminders when membership dues are coming due, but this is currently a manual process. Members can view their anniversary date and elapsed days in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18hA_YApZzsIMqaLGoGSISj51GmxtJtO2jJxnCy7NNWU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">private roster</a>.</p></br>
